**If this is your first time hearing about Scrive**, we recommend starting with the [scrive website](http://scrive.io) to learn about what Scrive is and why it's conception came about.

### Documentation
**Either if you are a developer, designer or the end-user**, it is advisable to read the [user docs](https://github.com/codePile/Scrive-Framework/wiki/User-Documentation) to get familiar with the application before diving into writing any code.

 - **The source of documentation for developers** working with (or contributing to) the Scrive project is located in this project's [wiki](https://github.com/codePile/Scrive-Framework/wiki).
 - **Documentation for designers/themers** can be found in the themers section of the wiki.

Keep in mind
The Docs are rough drafts for contributing to Scrive. (help me? Gulp!)
Work there is still in progress - mostlikly it will always will be.
Some pages are only outlines and there are many other topics left to go where no man has gone before.

## Stay tuned: more to come!
